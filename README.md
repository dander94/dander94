Here are some public projects I've coded / collaborated

- [Dander](https://gitlab.com/dander94/dander) - My personal website built with Next.js + Tailwind
- [Asistente Digital](https://gitlab.com/dander94/asistente-digital) - This is a firmware for a MSP432 written in C + FreeRTOS. It turns the device into a Digital Assistant for Dependant People. This was part of my bachelor final project.
- [Asistente Digital - Backend](https://gitlab.com/dander94/asistente-digital-backend) - The other part of my bachelor final project. This is a web application where you could configure your device. Again, docs are in spanish 😬
